### (add more companies, add more questions, and when in doubt, I will categorize it) <br/> (add solutions below if you have them! I will add instructions for contributions via MRs)

## âœ… Legend 
  * RED: Object oriented design 
  * ORANGE: System design
  * YELLOW: Algorithms 
  * GREEN: Leetcode and technical thinking questions 
  * GREY: Math questions and logic 
  * BLUE: Technical knowledge and project-based questions
  * PURPLE: Testing technical portions 
  * PINK: Behavioural Questions

## ðŸ”” Consensus
  * Twice a week, we are going to meet. We are going to discuss questions, we are going to do questions, we             are going to ask questions, we are going to contribute questions in order to get good at interviewing.
  * Wednesday 19:00 - 22:00 <br/>
    Saturday      13:30 - 16:30
  * I will make a zoom chat or a zoom link later
  * To contribute:
      1. Fork repository and open a branch, preferredly
      2. Edit README.md (I just used the Github Markdown Editor)
      3. Open a pull/merge request, and I will approve it!
  
## ðŸ“— Materials
  * Cracking the Code Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
  * Leetcode (Premium if you are ready to purchase, the $160/year seems to be a good deal)
