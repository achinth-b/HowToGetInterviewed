# ðŸ§µ Arrays and strings

## Things to remember and notes:

### Things to ask:
* is using another integer considered a use of another data structure?

### Runtimes you need to memorize
* Hash table insertion:
    * linked list implementation: O(n) 
    * bst/heap implementation: O(log n)

### Nifty Tricks
* In Java, strings and arrays are implemented the same
* Strings are pass by copy, so make sure to analyse this in in runtime for how long it takes without stringbuilder
* If you use stringbuilder, the copy only happens when you call toString(), and insertion is O(1)
* Refer to Rabin-Karp substring search using hash 
* Hashsets are really useful for targeting uniqueness
* Use stringbuilder whenever you need to generate a new code 
* bit vector > boolean array
* When solving for matrices, try to solve for space!!
